            <h4>Our Glue, Our Rock, Our Everything &hearts;</h4>
            <p>Dorothy also known as "Dot" was the strongest woman that everyone ran to. 
                <p>Regardless if you were a stranger on the street, she took you in.
                <p> If you needed the shirt on her back, she gave it. If you were hungry, she gave you the last bite of food on her plate even if she wads starving.</p>
            <p><i>I'm honored to dedicate this page to my mommy &hearts;</i><p>
                We have been incomplete since her passing in 2017 but her legacies live on through her famous recipe's and life lessons that are carried on by her children.
